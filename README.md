## üìÅ Projects Overview

### üè¶ Banking Exercise

The banking module includes the core functionality of a simple banking system, including deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history. Unit tests are also provided to validate the logic.

#### How to Run

2. Run the `main` method.
3. Follow the input prompts in the console.

#### Console Output Example

The application provides clear feedback for each operation:

## üí° Bonus Questions ‚Äì Design Discussion

### 1. Should we put all the functions inside the same service?

No, placing all functions in a single service is not recommended. It breaks the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and leads to tightly coupled, hard-to-maintain code.

Instead, functions should be distributed across multiple focused services‚Äîeach handling a specific responsibility (e.g., `BookingService`, `RoomService`). This promotes **locality of behavior**, improves testability, and enhances modularity.

### 2. In this design, we chose to have a `setRoom(...)` method that should not affect previous bookings. What is another way? What do you recommend?

A better approach is to avoid mutating the existing data and instead use **immutable** or **Clone** objects.
